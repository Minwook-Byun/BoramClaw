clean technical workflow diagram, white background, modern flat infographic style, centered title 'OpenClaw VC P1 수집/승인 로직', Korean labels, high readability, clear arrows, balanced spacing.

2-lane layout:
- Lane A (VC 중앙 오케스트레이터)
- Lane B (스타트업 로컬 Gateway)

Flow sequence:
1) Telegram command '/vc collect acme 7d'
2) Command parser + tenant registry lookup
3) Gateway health check
4) POST /manifest (기간, 문서유형, OCR 옵션)
5) Gateway scans agreed shared folder and returns artifact metadata
6) POST /artifact-content pull (selected files)
7) filename rule classification + lightweight OCR fallback
8) AES-256-GCM encrypted bundle save to vault/<startup_id>/...
9) metadata json + sqlite records (collections, artifacts)
10) auto verification checks (file exists, counts match, sha set match, decrypt match, db match)
11) approval queue create (status: pending)
12) Telegram notify: '수집 완료 + 승인 필요'
13) '/vc approve <approval_id>' or reject
14) approved only -> email dispatch + audit log update

Policy callouts:
- consent-based shared folder only
- no full desktop capture in P1
- external send requires approval gate
- tenant isolation: per-startup key and storage path

Visual style:
- rounded boxes, thin connectors, numbered step badges
- green for success path, amber for pending approval, red for reject path
- no photorealism, no people, no clutter, no watermark
